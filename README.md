# AoC2022

While many of the Python solutions on Reddit seem to focus on solving the problems with as few lines of code as possible, my approach is different. I want my code to be <b>Pythonic</b>, that is, <b>understandable</b> and <b>readable</b>, <b>PEP8 compliant</b>, and also <b>Mypy in strict mode</b> should be happy about the type annotations. This may result in slightly slower code, but I found that most of the really short unreadable and incomprehensible solutions on Reddit were NOT or only marginally faster than my code. I also try to use only the standard 'batteries' that come with Python.

I appreciate all suggestions for improvement in performance or otherwise, as long as they keep the code pythonic.

Cheers!
